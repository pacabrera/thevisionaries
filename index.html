                            <p>Having the greatest quality of being passionate, caring, and generosity, I came up with a
                                mission that composed of love and humanity. Looking to our situation today, there are
                                some individuals that are neglected by the world. They have been deprived from their
                                rights to live and been deprived to a healthy and safe environment. As per my personal
                                life mission, what I can do is to show my care by being a part of the body of Christ.
                            </p>

                                A Hand, Mouth and Ears â€“ part of the body that would best represent my personal life
                                mission. Lending my hands to everyone; hands that can give a secure and clean
                                environment for everyone. Using my mouth to address the problems to be solved; being the
                                voice of the cries of our citizens and our land; and lending my Ears to people unheard.
                                That is the way where I can share my care and generosity; this is the way where I can
                                show what I am passionate about. By this mission, I am sure that everyone will live in
                                peace, will gain their happiness, and will experience a home that is clean, healthy, and
                                safe to live in.

                                and I believe that God has granted me all kinds of abilities
                                and skills that I can share and educate young minds, and I

                                because you don't want to regret why you

                In the journey of our advocacy, tree-planting at home, we have learned to be more aware of the
                importance and benefits of the plants that we are taking care off. Various ways of protecting
                and
                maintaining the plants are learned, engagements to different people are improved with the use of
                Social
                media Platform and learning to appreciate God given hand that helped us to grow our plants that
                can
                contribute to protecting and adding to the beauty of our environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                On our first progress report, we know less about what we can do but we have learned more on the
                process
                of doing our advocacy. Now, we are still learning to know more about the things that we can do
                and
                aiming for our goal; to have an improved nature and environment condition, having the assurance
                of
                everyoneâ€™s safety and to be able to make everyone plant trees, treasure, and appreciate Godâ€™s
                creation.
            </p>
            <p>
                While doing our GTAP, we were surprised with the fact that we were able to encourage our whole
                household
                to plant on our own homes and we have reached several engagements in our Facebook Page. With our
                simple
                advocacy, we have encouraged people to plant, to learn their benefits and importance, and with
                that, we
                became a steward of our mainland.
            </p>
            <p>
                Still, we wanted to be more aware of the current state of the environment. If trees are being
                cut down
                here in Angeles City, what more in places that are fully modernized. We are willing to know more
                about
                what we could do in fighting this issue. We believe that we could do more, only if we are
                educated about
                the topic because deforestation is also a complex topic and as of now, we only know little of
                the
                matter. Before it came down to deforestation there are a lot of factors why it came to be like
                that,
                there are protocols, things to be considered, and legal actions that are needed to be
                understood. We
                also wanted to learn what we could do in preventing deforestation from happening and what
                alternative
                solution we could offer.

                The visionaries aim to inspire and persuade people about the importance of having plants or gardens in
                our homes. One of the most important contributions of our advocacy creation has been to inspire other
                people to plant or give a short time about maintaining gardening and having it in their home to save our
                environment and protect against issues such as the worsening of climate change and we think through
                that, we became more aware and conscious of the environmental risks and problems that our country is
                facing as we continue to create our advocacy project. Before, we tend to disregard several environmental
                issues because we did not have any time to look into the problem. But now, especially when there were
                different issues of tree-cutting occurring in our areas, our Advocacy changed the way we view our
                environment. We became more cautious, protective, and appreciative. We became grateful for doing this
                because no one can stop us even with the pandemic. We can still make a move to contribute to our
                environment. It may be tough for some of us because at first, we have no idea yet but because our
                course, Theology, has given us insights and purpose on why we should continue to help our nature and
                take care of our Godâ€™s creation. Due to that, we were inspired to do the project for us to raise
                awareness to people who are unaware of the several tree cuttings in our country and how dangerous it is
                for us. Our â€˜communication' is the key here in achieving our mission and development, which is why there
                will be no action if we do not interact in this team.

                The advocacy project was an eye-opener for us. We believe that it has changed our perspective and our
                ways of thinking towards our interaction with the environment. It helped our personal growth to develop
                wherein we are able to change our behaviours and habits. It enabled us to become a person who wants to
                provide help or even a solution even if it does not have any big impact. Before, we used to only think
                of ourselves and wait for a miracle to happen. But because of our advocacy project, motivated us to move
                and act because that is how it was really supposed to be. Our old habits, like we spend most of our time
                on the internet, became more helpful because we used it in a good way, like, we were able to go out and
                find ways to plant trees, convince people and sign our petitions, and even inform other people through
                social media. Ever since we became aware of such environmental problems, we came to the thought that the
                solution would start with us. This advocacy is extremely beneficial to us. Particularly, establishing a
                small vegetable garden. It allowed us to feel relieved from stress. Additionally, the feeling of
                satisfaction that we influence other people makes us realize that we are really helping others in a
                small way. We gave some of our time to give back to our nature though our schedule is packed with
                different tasks from different courses. That is because we choose to grow from obliviousness, we grew as
                we grew our plants.

                The process of the advocacy project took a long time to be finished and during those times, we learned
                how to team up with one another in order for us to present the project at its finest and also for the
                task to be done easily and quickly. We can say that the teamwork in our group was incredible because we
                are all responsible. We saw how each member contributed. Particularly in the part where we interacted
                with others, even if it was only through social media. We take turns when doing some needed engagement
                with our Facebook page for the project, we also make sure that all of us are present and participating
                when we would have a group meeting, and everyone is open when it comes to suggestions of ideas, we were
                able to connect our ideas with one another, helping each other, and we do not let one of us be left
                behind which we think helped a lot in doing the said project. If they are having a hard time finding a
                solution to a specific problem, we find ways to solve that. Especially that we have a great leader who
                guides us and keeps us organized and aligned. Due to this, we could say that accomplishing the advocacy
                was a team effort. While in the means of social participation, we make sure that we do not just interact
                with our group members but also with other people. Because of the advocacy, we were able to participate
                socially by sharing posts and posting information about our project on social media. The project not
                only made collaboration possible in our group but also made social participation possible. That is why
                our group is progressive and successful because all of us are moving and are willing to give our time
                and effort to the Advocacy Project. The team indeed met the expected outcomes from the advocacy project
                â€“ cooperation, stewardship, and social conscience.

                As a group, we think that it wonâ€™t be difficult to continue planting because some are fond of it, and
                some are already making planting a hobby. We would continue to take care of our nature not only because
                it is a requirement but because there is a will inside of us that keeps us doing this and we will
                continue this and apply it because we care for our environment. Before, we did not care about these
                advocacies, but now as we are tasked to do such, we became our own kind of leaders. We enjoyed and
                appreciated it especially that we are contributing to our environment. Each of us in the team learned
                much about stewardship and collaboration. Even though the project in our subject was already done, our
                learning could still be continuously applied because we were taught to have social conscience, upholding
                the responsibility for the problems and injustice of our society. We will always remember its importance
                even if the advocacy project is about to come to an end. We will apply the learnings we had in our
                course, Theology because God created this for us and we should treasure it, protect it, and love it. We
                will continue the page by sharing more information regarding planting trees so that many people will be
                convinced to plant more and sign more petitions to stop cutting the trees. We could say that we have
                become more of an environmentalist because of the different learnings from the project and it would be
                easy to apply this for something that has been learned for almost 5 months. Overall, the advocacy
                project is a success and we gained much knowledge about it. It is not only the plants who grew but us as
                well. We would always remember the vision and mission in our advocacy, and we think that we are
                continuing the purpose of the project.
