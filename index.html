                                mission that composed of love and humanity. Looking to our situation today, there are
                                some individuals that are neglected by the world. They have been deprived from their
                                rights to live and been deprived to a healthy and safe environment. As per my personal
                                life mission, what I can do is to show my care by being a part of the body of Christ.
                            </p>

                                A Hand, Mouth and Ears – part of the body that would best represent my personal life
                                mission. Lending my hands to everyone; hands that can give a secure and clean
                                environment for everyone. Using my mouth to address the problems to be solved; being the
                                voice of the cries of our citizens and our land; and lending my Ears to people unheard.
                                That is the way where I can share my care and generosity; this is the way where I can
                                show what I am passionate about. By this mission, I am sure that everyone will live in
                                peace, will gain their happiness, and will experience a home that is clean, healthy, and
                                safe to live in.

                                The parts of the Body of Christ are all beautiful and truly fulfilling. Based on my
                                mission I identified myself as Christ’s arms. I am willing to welcome everyone, spread
                                love, comfort, and help no matter what the circumstances are. I am ready to lift others
                                up and push them to the right path, I am Christ’s arms that encourage others to spread
                                love and motivation.

                                negatives that society gives, and most importantly to spread positive values and faith
                                in life in order for them to have encouraged themselves to focus on their goals,
                                trusting themselves, and enjoying doing their best so that at the end of the day they
                                will learn and improve not regretting.
